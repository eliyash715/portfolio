                        <h1>Hello, I am Eliyash Bah</h1>
                        <p>I live in the state of Maryland not too far from the District of Columbia. I have lived here for over 15 years now, I love the state and the people. It's a very friendly place to raise children, and also there are a lot of opportunities in the state.
                        I graduated in 2011 from the University of Maryland at College Park with a BA in economics. After, I decided to pursue a career in information technology to become a QA analyst. 
                        I am  currently a student at Thinkful, an online Bootcamp, studying to become a software engineer.</p>

                    <div class="item item-double">
                        <p>While learning to become a software engineer, I have been writing a lot of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. 
                            I use HTML to build web pages and CSS for styling, and finally use JavaScript for dynamically updating the webpage. 
                            During my years of experience as a quality assurance analyst, I have worked with software engineers, business analysts, and project managers. 
                            It's during my time as a QA tester and in collaboration with software engineers that I fell in love with and appreciated the value of software engineers. 
                            I am interested in software engineering because I can build software applications that have a direct impact on people's day-to-day activities and collaborate with like-minded software engineers to build efficient and clean code.
                        </p>
                        <p>When I am not at work, I usually enjoy going to finish with my family and friends, playing soccer, and basketball. I also enjoy mentoring young kids on how to become software engineers.</p>
