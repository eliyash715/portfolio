                        <h1>Hello. I am Eliyash Bah</h1>
                        <p>I live in the state of Maryland not too far from the District of Columbia.I have live here for over 15 years now, I love the state and the people. It's a very friendly place to raise children, and also there are a lot of opportunities in the state.
                        I graduated in 2011 from the University of Maryland at College Park with a BA in economics. After, I decided to pursue a career in information technology to become a QA analyst. 
                        I am  currently a student at Thinkful, an online bootcamp, studying to become a software engineer.</p>

                    <div class="item item-double">
                        <p>While learning to become a software engineer, I have been writing a lot of HTML, CSS and JavaScript code. I use HTML to build webpages and CSS for styling, and finally use JavaScript for dynamically updating the webpage.
                        During my years of experiences as quality assurance analyst, I have worked with software engineers, business analyst and project managers. It's during my time as QA tester and in collaboration with software engineers that I became in love and appreciated the value of software engineers.
                        I am interested in software engineering because I can build software applications that have a direct impact on people day to day activities. Collaborate with like minded software engineers to build efficient and clean code
                        </p>
                        <p>When I am not at work, I usually enjoy going out to finishing with my family and friendly, playing soccer, and basketball. I also enjoy mentoring youngs kids on how to become a software engineer </p>
